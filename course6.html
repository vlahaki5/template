			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>This course overall has been learning experience after learning experience, and I am truly glad that I decided to put the work in. Without attempting anything, it seems like this class in impossible, but after going right in and trying, I can say personally that it was all attainable, and I had the skills required to get all the work done. This course start to end required at lot of work, yes, but all of that work coalesced into skills for tomorrow, these skills will be with me for a long time. Learning about writing is one of the most useful skills one can have, and this course took that to an entirely new level, requiring the class to rethink what they knew, and forcing us to apply what we already knew into new forms of media. Turning an ordinary paper into a documentary is a very hard task to accomplish for the average student, but this course forces you to do just that, and that is extremely fulfilling when it is finally finished. The most valuable lesson I learned from each and every one of these papers is to pace myself, and make sure that I know what I’m going to do before I do it.</p>	</content>
