			<h1>Background Information</h1>
			<p>As Michael Gonin, a writer at the Journal of Academic Ethics states, “Business research and teaching institutions play an important role in shaping the way businesses perceive their relations to the broader society and its moral expectations.” He goes on to say, “Hence, as ethical scandals recently arose in the business world, questions related to the civic responsibilities of business scholars and to the role business schools play in society have gained wider interest.” Michael clearly shows that scholars play key roles in the world of business, and are very important for keeping business ethical. He writes in such a way that clearly shows how business effects the world around itself. Further on in the article, he went on to say, “The positivist approach certainly contributed to the rise of the Western liberal market economy with its relative high level of welfare. The rigorous scientific methodology contributed to numerous discoveries and inventions which added to today’s welfare – e.g., production automation, information technology, or medical progress. Further, positivist management research has contributed to important progress in the way businesses (especially bigger ones) can be managed.” Academic writing is very analytical in business, and takes education to fully understand. However, the information is vital to anyone that is looking to make a career in the field of business.</p>
