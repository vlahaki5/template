			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>This will be met with backlash, and soon after acceptance. Changing a whole population’s way of interaction will be an incredibly hard thing to do, and many kids would be resentful of the very notion of having to communicate with others. People don’t like being forced to change, however, it will be for the better. Beginning with the brute force idea might not be the best for the short term, however, in the long term it will pay off. It will not be an easy thing to implement, and a long time to get right, however, in the long run, it will be better. Mostly kids will be the ones that are mad about it, and allowing them to keep everything in their lives except their current social behavior will be very good for everyone. If we don’t disallow anything, but at the same time push people to talk to each other, they will hopefully accept the idea, and possibly even embrace being more social when they see how it has a positive bearing on their life. It will probably not save the current generation, but it may safe future generations. After all is said and done, social interaction will increase, and thus increase they success of the generation. Social interaction is needed to get places, and with a stronger generation, our country and our world will become a better place. We also may be a more unified culture with less anger, and more structure.</p>	</article>
