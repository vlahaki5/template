			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>Video games are a great thing in moderation, however, they lead to large social issues. The entertainment value is hard for people to pass up, and thus leads to addictions. Some video game addictions can be crippling to social behavior, and really hurt the global social ecosystem. If we push people to be more social, and allow them to continue playing video games, then we will have a more successful and prosperous generation. The key is to not take anything away from anyone, but rather just show them the right ways to do things, and teach moderation to the younger generations. This will take a long time to perfect, and will be very slow to implement. We all need to be social, or the world wouldn’t work as well, and success would be rarer. We all want an extremely successful and prosperous generation. Video games aren’t the only cause of social anxiety, however, they are a large one. Over time, the problems will just get worse, but if we take steps to mitigate the effects that things such as video games present, then we can overcome some if not all of the social issues that they present, and increase social interaction between all kids and adults. After all is said and done, we will all have better communicational skills, and will be able to interact much better as a whole. Hopefully for the future generations to come, they will; be more prosperous, and further cement the fact that the United States is one of the strongest countries in the world.</p>
