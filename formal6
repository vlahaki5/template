			<p>As Marc Redfield, the author of the book George Eliot and Europe states, “Over the hut half-century, English has become so thoroughly the academy's lingua franca that in the United States even the "modern languages" conduct much of their business in it. Fifty years ago PMLA published articles in German, Spanish, and French, and expected at least a portion of its general readership to read them; today, an untranslated quotation would be unthinkable. The universalization of English has been accompanied by historical and institutional developments that have transformed literary study--the cold-war expansion and professionalization of the American university, the displacement of philology by criticism, and so on--and there is certainly no point in lamenting the disappearance of an erudition that has been replaced by other discursive and interpretative skills.”  
With this, we can clearly see that over 1/7 people in the world use English, and this is extremely useful in business. He went on to say, “Yet we also need to attend to the ways in which monolingualism has reconfigured our discipline's perception of its object, particularly in a field like Victorian studies. As we all know, Victorian literature, so accessible in cont ent and form, so integral to our imaginative lives, is permeated by classical, Biblical, and contemporary European traditions--traditions in which we are perfectly capable of educating ourselves, but which represent alternatives or supplements to the sort of training that now generally results in a "Victorianist." As a professional object of study, Victorian literature thereby becomes something other than itself; and the metamorphosis is so subtle, and so well-hidden by the familiarity of the canonical texts, that we only occasionally attend to it.” This clearly shows how important understanding English is in business. He shows that business is now primarily done in English, and thus knowing how to read and interpret it at a very high level is extremely advantageous to anyone looking to make a career in business. Furthermore, even if you don’t live in an English speaking country, you will get the edge if you learn how to speak English at a high level.
Writing and reading is also required for businesses to make informed legal decisions. It allows companies to understand the changing laws, and allows them to abide by them. Scholars help by making it easy for businesses to have access to this information, however, you must understand what you’re looking at in order to ensure that you make accurate decisions. As the Harvard Law Review states, “On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court handed down its decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (1) (NFIB), upholding President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2) (ACA or Act). For months, the public, jurists, and scholars alike had debated the constitutionality of the Act's "individual mandate," a provision requiring anyone who failed to purchase health insurance to make a payment to the federal government. (3) NFIB ended that debate, holding that the mandate exceeded Congress's authority to regulate commerce but not its authority to tax. The Court held that the Commerce Clause authorized the regulation of only commercial activity and that, by assessing a payment on individuals' decisions not to purchase health insurance, the mandate regulated inactivity. By contrast, the Taxing Clause authorized the regulation of inactivity, and it was possible to construe the mandate as a tax. Thus, while the mandate fell outside of Congress's commerce power, it could survive as a valid exercise of the taxing power.” This shows how laws change in regards to business, and the ability to read the information put out is extremely necessary for any business to operate legally. The ability to interpret this information could mean the difference between legal issues, and operating with the law.
