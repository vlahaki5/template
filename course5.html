			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>The writing process of the formal research project was very strenuous, and took quite a while. Articulating my thoughts in a meaningful way, as to convey a message that was both insightful and entertaining was a hard task to accomplish, but through writing that paper, I learned a few ways to do just that. Using personal experience was a big one, showing that I know firsthand what something is like, and then showing that some professional in the field knows the same thing, I established myself as knowledgeable and trustworthy on the subject matter, and brought the readers to believe what I say as the truth. Another thing to do is to try to simplify the content so that it doesn’t go over people’s heads. To do this, I attempted to tone down the vocabulary that I used, and the paper came across much more friendly as a result of that. By the end of the paper, I believe that I taught the reader valuable lessons about business, and how it works both on a scholarly level, and on an individual level as well. If I were to go back, I would definitely cut out some unnecessary content, as to remove some fat, so to speak. Oversaturating the content with additional sentences, and unneeded clauses just made the project as a whole much less pleasant to read. To anyone going into this project I say to you, pace yourself, take your time finding credible sources, make sure that your content is appropriate for what you’re trying to convey, and don’t wait until the last minute.</p>	</footer>
