SUBJECT:		WRA 110 Group Project<br><br>

	This project was quite a challenge for my whole group (myself included). My group as a whole worked very well together, and we got along fine. However, the project didn’t go extremely smoothly. With our limited recourses (using Windows Movie Maker), and our extreme lack of skill, it was hard to create a project that was very good. Being primarily business majors, and having little understanding of how to create a documentary, we primarily used clips from others, and put our own statistics in there with voiceover, because we didn’t even know where to begin if we were to use all of our own film. Nevertheless, I believe the project turned out the best we could have created with our limited knowledge, and my team worked hard on our busy schedules to find time for it. Things that didn’t go so well were getting content to fill the gaps that we had. Finding enough film, and making it meaningful was quite difficult. Also, basing our film off the TV show Shameless added a whole new layer of complexity, requiring us to find small segments from the show and integrating them in a meaningful and clean way. Having little knowledge on the topic and the show as a whole, I was forced to improvise, and use primarily statistics to back my points. The editing process was primarily just getting everything to work together, this was exceptionally difficult, however, we knew it was integral to the film as a whole, and required a large amount of attention. The group was highly under skilled as a whole in video manipulation, and I believe that solely due to that, the film looks very “cheap”, so to speak. With all that said, I truly believe that we put the best forth with our limitations, and overcame multiple obstacles. I believe given more time that the final outcome would not be much different, however, given adequate recourses, I believe that our team could have thrived. Everyone showed exceptional attention to the issue at hand, and though we didn’t know exactly what we were doing, I know that we completed the project to the best of our ability, and I am proud of the work that we achieved with our level of understanding. One thing that I would have liked to change about the film/project is its insistence on the importance of the TV show. I would have personally liked to take the project on in a different light, but I digress majority rules, and without fully understanding how required the integration of the first paper’s content was, I backed down and allowed the show to stay in the project. All in all, I learned a lot from this project, and definitely took away some meaningful lessons about collaboration, and creating films. The only issue I had was that I did not fully understand what was needed for the film, however, I do not know if this is due to my own misinterpretations, or just not fully understanding the material. I think the project opened my eyes to the possibilities that my group could achieve, and also opened the doors to new possibilities in the future due to my newly learned skills, albeit they are very weak skills that need further exploration to hone in on. The issue that we chose was quite easy, we came to the conclusion that poverty would become the most interesting video. The places of issue was getting good information, and it was quite difficult to decide what order to put all of the content in, and how to portray it. Our approach was systematic, we used an outline and wrote a script. We used many places for research, multiple videos, and many sites, such as YouTube. The least useful source was databases, as they provide very good content, they are mostly useful for cross referencing your information. We planned our work well, and split it accordingly. The project was very well all together, and our plan was used, and we stayed true to our original ideas. If I had to do it over, I would spend much more time in the editing phase of the process. Our most effective piece was the pictures, and the statistics. These two things really conveyed the message well. We all collaborated to come up with what would work the best.
