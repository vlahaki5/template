			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>The formal research project was my most difficult project, and thus the one I believe needs to be talked about the most. To begin, I was torn on what to do with it. I looked into multiple topics ranging from (yet again) video games to medicine, but I decided that I was going to go down the road of business, as I have a background in that as well. From the beginning I knew that this project was going to bring me the most trouble, I have little experience with research projects, and generally try to avoid them at all costs. I started with using things such as SIRS Researcher, and GALE to obtain credible sources, and to figure out how I was going to structure the project. After gathering together multiple sources, I began writing with many issues. To begin, I didnâ€™t know where to start. Whilst writing the first paragraph, I determined that it would be extremely difficult to meet the lengthy word requirement, and I was forced to find more and more sources. If I had to go back I would definitely begin with gathering a plethora of sources, and preparing content for each source. Given that I know a thing or two about business, I figured out the best thing to do was to use what I already know and back up my claims with credible sources. The sources I found ranged from academic journals to scholarly articles, and in using such advanced sources, I believe that my paper gained and extreme amount of credibility.</p>	<footer>
