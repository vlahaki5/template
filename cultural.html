			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>Video games are some of the most entertaining things on the market, and anyone can enjoy them. They range from massive multiplayers to first person shooters, and capture the imagination of developers and players alike. Anyone can find something they enjoy, because there is so much variety. People have always wanted a way to immerse themselves in artificial universes, and have been finding ways to do so for a long time. It started with board games, and continued with things like magic the gathering, and dungeons and dragons. Over time video games have increased in graphical fidelity, and have become some of the most beautiful and artistic displays of talent on the market. The accessibility of video games is what makes them the most appealing to most people. The ability to just pick up a game and play for a few hours is an extremely attractive proposition to anyone. These different things all led up to the eventual boom of video games. Once people got their hands on video games, the idea took off. Video games have been around for a while now, and have made a big impact on everyone. However, video games have a negative side as well. Though they are fun, they involve a lot of commitment, and waste a lot of time. This time could be spent elsewhere, and people don’t know how to be moderate; this has been an inherent problem with our species for a long time. This effects people from children the most, and as much as 8% of children have addictions (Video Game Addiction). Eight percent may seem like a small amount of people, however, this is where the problem starts; the issue will continue to grow and grow until it consumes a majority of a generation. Video game addiction is slowly becoming a very large problem in society. Though it hasn’t become something truly dangerous right this minute, that doesn’t mean we should ignore the fact entirely, large issues take time to manifest. Once they reach over 50% we will have a society full of socially uncomfortable people, and the United Sates will begin to fall behind in power.</p>
