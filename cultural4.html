			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>If we are to fix this issue, it would begin with increasing social activities in schools. Basically what needs to be done is a change of the schooling system entirely, and imposing certain laws that would require schools to have social activities. Certain times during the day would need to be allocated towards social activities, and a strong attempt to not leave anyone left out needs to be there. Everyone would need to be involved in the effort, otherwise it would not work. Kids are already at school learning, so their full attention is already on school, presumably, and they are more willing to learn new things. One of the few places that kids can’t play video games (as easily) is school, so whilst they’re trapped, they should be required to socialize with their peers. The social interaction should not be pushed so much as it should be slowly introduced. Social order in schools is very hierarchical, and orderly, and is a simple representation of society as a whole. If we force people to interact in the manner, kids would learn how society works, and how to interact. Fixing the issue that video games present would involve social activities, and incentivizing doing so. This would involve teaching how to interact, and then slowly pushing kids to do so. The amount of people that get social anxiety is astronomically high, and forcing them out of their shell may be the best way to go. Start with social communicational classes, and then slowly introduce them to the idea that being social is a part of our species, and an evolutionary adaptation that is required for this world to work. Teach kindness, and learning about social interaction. Also, increase public speaking classes, and increase communication classes. </p>
