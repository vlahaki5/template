			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>By the time I was 75% done with my paper, I had run out of content to put in the paper. I had said everything I wanted to say, and then some, and I was at a crossroad. My two choices were accept the markdown, or find more sources to talk about, I chose the latter. As previously stated, finding sources (and a lot of them) is extremely beneficial to the paper, and doing it beforehand is also very nice because it helps not having to break the pace that youâ€™re working at to find more content. Looking back, I know that the best thing to do would be to find my sources, read through them, gain an understanding about what they are trying to convey, and writing the paper based on your findings. Another thing I found to be critical was to make sure the content was not too dry, as to put off readers. Getting a research project to be exciting is a very hard thing to do, and it requires dedication. 	<p>&copy; 2014 Stephen Vlahakis</p>
