		<p>The video was very moving. The way he depicted his life was very dark, but it was presented in such a way that it had
		a light tone. His emotion towards his uncle was very moving, I've personally never been in a situation where I lost a 
		loved one, however, I can't even begin to imagine how it would have a massive bearing on my life. Knowing that
		this man went through such a struggle, I feel very bad for him.</p>
		<p>I had no clue of the true extent that homosexuals go through, and I honestly hate the treatment that they go through.
		To think that someone would kill themselves because they felt discriminated against is extremely offputing. I am glad
		that this man made this video, and hearing his story makes me want to get involved in some way. However, I feel there
		isn't much one can do in the way of changing the general publics opinion. I do believe, however, that things are slowly 
		changing for the better, and I hope to one day see a world without such discrimination.</p>
		<p>As a straight white male, I have never been in a situation where I have been treated differently because of 
		something about me. I don't fully mean that, because I have, however, I have never been in a situation where
		I was actually hurt by something someone said about a feature of me.</p>
		<p>The world is a very cruel place, and this video has really exposed that. I for one wish it could 
			change over night, but it is much more difficult than that. Furthermore, I believe that videos
			that expose this truth really help to move along progress, and bring attention to people that really
			didn't know about the mistreatment of homosexuals. I believe that everyone knows about it, but most
			people don't know the severity of it, or the concequenses of it.
