	  <h1>Blog_Response</h1>
		<p>The video was very moving. The way he depicted his life was very dark, but it was presented in such a way that it had
		a light tone. His emotion towards his uncle was very moving, I've personally never been in a situation where I lost a 
		loved one, however, I can't even begin to imagine how it would have a massive bearing on my life. Knowing that
		this man went through such a struggle, I feel very bad for him.</p>
		<p>I had no clue of the true extent that homosexuals go through, and I honestly hate the treatment that they go through.
		To think that someone would kill themselves because they felt discriminated against is extremely offputing. I am glad
		that this man made this video, and hearing his story makes me want to get involved in some way. However, I feel there
		isn't much one can do in the way of changing the general publics opinion. I do believe, however, that things are slowly 
		changing for the better, and I hope to one day see a world without such discrimination.</p>
		<p>As a straight white male, I have never been in a situation where I have been treated differently because of 
		something about me. I don't fully mean that, because I have, however, I have never been in a situation where
		I was actually hurt by something someone said about a feature of me.</p>
		<p>The world is a very cruel place, and this video has really exposed that. I for one wish it could 
			change over night, but it is much more difficult than that. Furthermore, I believe that videos
			that expose this truth really help to move along progress, and bring attention to people that really
			didn't know about the mistreatment of homosexuals. I believe that everyone knows about it, but most
			people don't know the severity of it, or the concequenses of it.
		</p>
		<p>The message of this video is to bring attention to the mistreatment, and discrimination of homosexuals. He breaks
			it down into parts explaining what it's like to be gay in a world that hates gay people.
			The video attempts to acheive its purpose by connecting with people on an emotional level, and 
			getting people to feel what it would be like to be in such a situation. The video does well 
			in conveying its message. It can help with my paper by starting off with a story, and then delving 
			deeper into the issue, and really explaining what it is like to be in my position, and hopefully
			getting people to attach on an emotional level. Getting people on an emotional level is very difficult
			to do, but, it is the best way to get people to care about your message.
