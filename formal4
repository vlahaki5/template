			<h1>Communication Section</h1>
			<p>Nick Vlahakis, the owner of the largest commercial real estate company in mid-Michigan stated that, “Business is needed for any place to thrive.” He went on to say, “Without business (small or large) the economy wouldn’t work, and we would need an entirely different system.” Without companies, regular people would have no means of employment, and thus the whole system wouldn’t work. I then asked if he believed that business would play a large role in a developing society, and he stated, “Any new and upcoming economy will not succeed without the help of small and large business, and it will require the government to incentivize business to thrive.” I followed up by asking how research and writing is important in his day to day, and he said, “Reading and writing are some of the most important skills you can learn in this field, not only do you need to constantly communicate with other people in the field, but you also need to read and interpret the information from different places.” I then asked how he felt about the current educational requirements in regards to the business discipline, and he stated, “I believe that we need to push students to develop their reading and writing skills to an extremely high level, students need to understand the importance of business literacy in the field.”</p>
