		<h1>My Tech Life</h1>
		<p>	Having a device in your pocket that has access to basically all the information that everyone in the world knows was once a thing of science fiction, however, now it is one of the most prominent things in society. Computers have been around for over twenty years now, and have advanced exponentially in computing power. What once took hours to render, now takes minutes, maybe even seconds. Telephones were much more limited just five years ago, and now they can basically do anything. The almost scary rapid growth of technology only points to a future where anything is possible. Computers in our pockets have only been a thing as of recently, and have proven to be extremely versatile. Some people refer to them now as extensions of our own physical being.</p>
		<p>	Early cell phones were bulky, took up a ton of room, consumed a lot of power, and had minimal functionality. These phones were only available to only fairly wealthy people, and were very low quality. Over the generations, cell phones advanced into their own world. Before, phones were used for calling, however, now cellphones are used for other things a majority of the time. The fact that one small piece of technology covers such a wide array of uses led to the massive cellphone boom of the 2000’s. This massive increase in handheld computing initiated the dawn of a new generation. Current hardware will be nearly obsolete in six months, making it one of the fastest growing things every invented. It is impossible to go anywhere without seeing someone on their phone, and the fact is they could be doing anything from tweeting to checking their stocks.</p>
		<p>	Business has been a thing for an extremely long time, and really hasn’t changed much since it began. The premise is basically make money, or fail; the latter is much easier. Since the dawn of business, people have always been trying to optimize their methods, as to earn more money. Technology is how they always have done that. As of late, businesses have taken in the idea of computational technology, and used it in their favor. The use of computers can lead to an extreme increase in revenue, and efficiency. One cannot go into a business and not see a computer, or other form of computational technology being used. The ability to easily print off receipts, and keep track of everything everyone is doing is something no business owner can pass up. Computers span such a wide variety of uses, thus making them an all in one package that no one can resist.</p>
		<p>Business has always been a very large influence on my life. Since my early years, I have been surrounded by it. I always loved listening to my dad talk about everything he was doing with his business. My father owns the largest commercial real estate company in mid-Michigan, and I always learn from him. Needless to say, the influence from my family led to my decision to go into a business degree. My decision to peruse business has always been in my mind, and technology has only helped with that fact. At age 10, I began selling knives on the internet through eBay. This was a bit out of the ordinary, but I really enjoyed earning money in this fashion. I grew my business over the course of a couple years before abandoning that entirely, and moving on to another business. The decision to abandon it wasn’t overnight, but it happened fairly rapidly. This is where I began my window washing business, and everything began to really click. Making money became much more natural, and as I learned more, I began to use technology in my favor.</p>
		<p>Being the tech junkie that I am, I picked up the hobby of coding rather quickly, and began creating videogames, apps, etc. Learning these skills has been an amazing influence on my life. Technology has become an integral part to my business life. Everything I do now relates to technology. I am now onto buying and selling cars, and thus I have deduced that I will probably open a used car lot in the future. Buying and selling cars may seem easy, however, without some form of technology backing you, it’s easy to make mistakes. In the beginning of my car buying experience, I would basically just look at cars, and decide if I wanted them. Now, however, I run a full check on them using the internet, and use an app I developed to give me the exact price to pay to get the profit I desire. The different apps I use in my business world lead to a large increase productivity, and profit. Without certain technology such as my phone, I would be much less productive.</p>
		<p>My phone has become one of the most important tools at my disposal when it comes to business. I do practically everything on it, from record keeping to price checking. What led me to business was the fact that I was skilled in it, and the fact that I knew my way around a computer. Growing up in a fairly wealthy family, I had access to basically everything I needed to learn about computers. At age eleven, I got my first computer, and after learning mostly everything about it, I started applying my knowledge towards what I loved, business. Without computers, I would have never started my first online business, and thus, probably never getting into business as I am now. Things such as Excel really help out with everything that I do. I use Excel to keep records of every transaction that I do, and everything I buy. This simple piece of technology makes a massive impact on productivity. I used to do all of my record keeping on paper, and it had various problems. I once lost my notebook, and lost all record of everything I did. The loss of information was a major hindrance to my work, and led me to using Excel. Once I switched to that platform, my life became 100x easier, and since then I haven’t done anything on paper. The fact that everything can be done on a smartphone changed everything for me. The functionality, and versatility made business so easy, that it led me straight into that path. Without my phone, it would be much more tedious to do business, and just make the whole experience less pleasurable. </p>
		<p>Without things such as computers, I may have never chosen to do business, due to the fact that the whole process would be much less enjoyable. As technology gets better, so will my business life. My phone, and my business life have become one, and without my phone, my businesses would suffer extremely. I like to consider myself as an optimizer, someone that always wants to make what I have work better, or faster, and the way I generally do that is with my phone, or computer. Those two devices have shaped my whole business life, and have led to my entire life path. My love for technology when crossed with my love for business make a dynamic combination that would not work if not for the invention of handheld computers.</p>
