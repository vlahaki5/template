			<p>As Marc Redfield, the author of the book George Eliot and Europe states, “Over the hut half-century, English has become so thoroughly the academy's lingua franca that in the United States even the "modern languages" conduct much of their business in it. Fifty years ago PMLA published articles in German, Spanish, and French, and expected at least a portion of its general readership to read them; today, an untranslated quotation would be unthinkable. The universalization of English has been accompanied by historical and institutional developments that have transformed literary study--the cold-war expansion and professionalization of the American university, the displacement of philology by criticism, and so on--and there is certainly no point in lamenting the disappearance of an erudition that has been replaced by other discursive and interpretative skills.”  
With this, we can clearly see that over 1/7 people in the world use English, and this is extremely useful in business. He went on to say, “Yet we also need to attend to the ways in which monolingualism has reconfigured our discipline's perception of its object, particularly in a field like Victorian studies. As we all know, Victorian literature, so accessible in cont ent and form, so integral to our imaginative lives, is permeated by classical, Biblical, and contemporary European traditions--traditions in which we are perfectly capable of educating ourselves, but which represent alternatives or supplements to the sort of training that now generally results in a "Victorianist." As a professional object of study, Victorian literature thereby becomes something other than itself; and the metamorphosis is so subtle, and so well-hidden by the familiarity of the canonical texts, that we only occasionally attend to it.” This clearly shows how important understanding English is in business. He shows that business is now primarily done in English, and thus knowing how to read and interpret it at a very high level is extremely advantageous to anyone looking to make a career in business. Furthermore, even if you don’t live in an English speaking country, you will get the edge if you learn how to speak English at a high level.
Writing and reading is also required for businesses to make informed legal decisions. It allows companies to understand the changing laws, and allows them to abide by them. Scholars help by making it easy for businesses to have access to this information, however, you must understand what you’re looking at in order to ensure that you make accurate decisions. As the Harvard Law Review states, “On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court handed down its decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (1) (NFIB), upholding President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2) (ACA or Act). For months, the public, jurists, and scholars alike had debated the constitutionality of the Act's "individual mandate," a provision requiring anyone who failed to purchase health insurance to make a payment to the federal government. (3) NFIB ended that debate, holding that the mandate exceeded Congress's authority to regulate commerce but not its authority to tax. The Court held that the Commerce Clause authorized the regulation of only commercial activity and that, by assessing a payment on individuals' decisions not to purchase health insurance, the mandate regulated inactivity. By contrast, the Taxing Clause authorized the regulation of inactivity, and it was possible to construe the mandate as a tax. Thus, while the mandate fell outside of Congress's commerce power, it could survive as a valid exercise of the taxing power.” This shows how laws change in regards to business, and the ability to read the information put out is extremely necessary for any business to operate legally. The ability to interpret this information could mean the difference between legal issues, and operating with the law.

Writing comes in multiple forms, and for business it can be used in many ways. It can be used for promotion, contracts, etc. With the rise of social media, businesses are finding ways to further promote their business. These ways include promotions though said media outlets. As Stefanie Mosca, a writer for Inside Counsel Breaking News states, “Social media -- everybody's doing it, right? Whether people are using it to keep in touch with friends and family or brands are utilizing it as a communication tool to better engage with their customers, it seems like if you aren't on some kind of social media platform you are behind the curve. However, depending on the line of work you are in, its possible that social media is either irrelevant for your business or some industries are so traditional that they have yet to adapt to the latest digital tools.” She went on to say, “More traditional verticals like law and finance are beginning to understand that while social media may not make or break their business, it can certainly help to promote their services and interact with clients.” She shows that things such as social media don’t always push businesses forward, however, in some instances they do. This is especially true in sales. Sales can increase through the use of social media. Social media such as Facebook and Twitter help businesses show off what they have on a very popular website for free. However, this doesn’t work for things such as law firms and finance firms as well, as they do not need this form of advertising. This further cements the idea that writing is vital to the success of business in modern day times.

Businesses are required to make educated and informed decisions. This is done through proper education, and rational decision making. These skills are very hard to acquire, and take a lot of time to adapt. As the Journal of Business Research states, “The process of making decisions in business requires, among other things, the efficient management of information to do with employee competencies. Dealing solely with competencies that employees learn in institutional contexts, however, is insufficient, as employees also acquire competencies through informal learning activities outside the organization. If an organization is to make well-informed decisions, the entity must gather information about the external activities of its employees that contribute to their competency development.” Without an understanding of the field, and the ability to make rational decisions, one could end up making uninformed, uneducated, and bad decisions. The importance of decision making, according to the article, is extremely high.

With the amount of businesses growing every year, the number of total companies has reached an astonishing 34.5 million in 2012.  
As this graphic clearly shows, business is extremely influential, given that there are so many companies. One needs to be able to understand the analysis that people working in the research field present, so that they can stay informed, and make accurate decisions. Thus, reading and writing are two very important skills for anyone looking to study business needs to have. Businesses communicate with each other primarily through writing, thus making that skill second to none.

	Scholars, however, don’t always have valid information. As Bo Bernhard Nielsen, a writer in the Journal of Business Research points out, “Far too often do management scholars resort to crude and often inappropriate measures of fundamental constructs in their research; an approach which calls in question the interpretation and validity of their findings. Scholars often legitimize poor choices in measurement with a lack of availability of better measures and/or that they are simply following existing research in adopting previously published measures without critically assessing the validity, appropriateness, and applicability of such measures in terms of the focal study. Motivated by a recent dialog in Journal of Business Research, this research note raises important questions about the use of proxies in management research and argues for greater care in operationalizing constructs with particular attention to matching levels of theory and measurement.” People generally just take what scholars for what they say, because, well, they’re educated, right? This is not always correct, and sometimes they make claims that use incorrect information, and sometimes even flat out lies. This article clearly points out that we should not take all information as the truth, but rather, we should interpret what it says, and draw our own conclusions. This is a very analytical skill that can only be acquired through experience, and a strong education. The validity of information should be scrutinized, and we should not always fall victim to false information, be it from a scholar or not.
