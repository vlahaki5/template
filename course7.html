			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>	In conclusion, this class has taught me a lot about writing, and conveying messages in all sorts of different forms. I have learned to be much more responsible about time management, and I have learned to look at the broad picture, and then slowly move in on the minute details. It is always best, in my honest opinion, to get all of me thought down in a logical order, and to not underestimate the length and difficulty of a project before attempting it. Throughout the course I have personally advanced my creative side to new heights, and developed my skills to levels I previously thought unattainable. From the first project to the last, I have honed my skills in such a way that developing thoughtful literary pieces in the future should be of no concern. Looking back, I realize that I did a lot of complaining before even trying to do something, and that is one of my biggest mistakes as a writer. Developing papers that have zest and intelligence is not that difficult once I applied myself. To the future students of this class, if you take one thing from this paper, take this, try to do something before you claim that you canâ€™t, as you never truly know what you are capable of before you dive in.	<p>&copy; 2014 Stephen Vlahakis</p>
