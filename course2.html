			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>To begin, I have never been the best at writing. From the moment I began this course I had a bad feeling about what the future might hold, nevertheless, I held strong and did my work on time. The beginning was the easiest, starting with some simple papers, nothing too advanced. Throughout the progression of the course I developed new skills, and learned how to apply them to the issues at hand. The lived experiences project was one of my favorites, because it allowed me to truly express myself on a topic that I had a lot of knowledge about, and it allowed me to teach others what I knew. That project made me feel like an expert, and like I was truly skilled in something. I do, however, think that it could have gone better had I spent more time developing my thesis. The cultural analysis was also one that I liked, because it allowed me to delve into something that I didnâ€™t fully understand, but had interest in nonetheless. Video games, and video game related things always peak my interest, and the analysis of social anxiety was really interesting to me. I could have definitely done better on that one getting more sources, and possibly even more credible sources. I believe that my sources were completely fine and appropriate, however, I believe that I could have brought more to the table as far as content goes. Finally, the remix project; the remix project went better than expected. All-in-all, I believe that myself and my group did very well creating a project worthy of the grade it received, but if I had to go back, I would spend more time editing, and more time learning about film editing as to make the project look much better.</p>		</article>
