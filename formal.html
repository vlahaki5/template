			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>Business is a very important part of our society, and it requires immense research, and analysis to gain a full understanding of what it all entails. Moreover, it is extremely important that this information be presented in a very clear and concise way. Business is a very broad term, and thus, all analysis must be very broad, and look at the entire picture. It is extremely hard to get a full understanding of what is going on unless you step back and take time to do some research. Looking at large businesses, one might miss the true understanding of what makes business it’s greatest. Smaller businesses provide mostly everyone their needs, and are vital to a successful economy. Therefore, leaving small business out of the equation would be asinine, and would miss the entire point. Research is extremely important, and has its place in the business world. As The Business Journal states, small businesses are greatly affected by things that larger businesses don’t fret about, and thus, they are much more fragile. In conclusion, leaving small business out of analysis and research would have devastating consequences to our economy. This scholarly article writes in such a fashion that would be difficult to understand if you didn’t have a background in the business world.</p>
