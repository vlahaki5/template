			<p>Teaching in the field of business, be it at a university, or something you do through another business, you learn the importance of research, and the importance of writing. Ed Williams, an ex-employee at NAI Mid-Michigan Vlahakis Commercial, and teacher of various real estate courses explains the importance of writing in business, “Without writing, we would have no basis for understanding.” He went on to state, “We need writing, and research, otherwise, how would we make informed decisions? Writing in a real estate setting must be very formal, and is extremely necessary to get information to clients, and if you teach, to your students.” Ed continued with, “The world of ‘Business’ is quite a cutthroat place, and if you can’t keep up with what’s going on, then you won’t succeed. With the different forms of research, you can easily keep up, if you know what you’re looking at.” As Ed clearly shows, he uses writing, and research in his daily life, and without it business would not be able to operate. </p>
