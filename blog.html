	  <h1>Day 1 Blog Entry</h1>
		<p>The video was very moving. The way he depicted his life was very dark, but it was presented in such a way that it had
		a light tone. His emotion towards his uncle was very moving, I've personally never been in a situation where I lost a 
		loved one, however, I can't even begin to imagine how it would have a massive bearing on my life. Knowing that
		this man went through such a struggle, I feel very bad for him.</p>
		<p>I had no clue of the true extent that homosexuals go through, and I honestly hate the treatment that they go through.
		To think that someone would kill themselves because they felt discriminated against is extremely offputing. I am glad
		that this man made this video, and hearing his story makes me want to get involved in some way. However, I feel there
		isn't much one can do in the way of changing the general publics opinion. I do believe, however, that things are slowly 
		changing for the better, and I hope to one day see a world without such discrimination.</p>
		<p>As a straight white male, I have never been in a situation where I have been treated differently because of 
		something about me. I don't fully mean that, because I have, however, I have never been in a situation where
		I was actually hurt by something someone said about a feature of me.</p>
		<p>The world is a very cruel place, and this video has really exposed that. I for one wish it could 
			change over night, but it is much more difficult than that. Furthermore, I believe that videos
			that expose this truth really help to move along progress, and bring attention to people that really
			didn't know about the mistreatment of homosexuals. I believe that everyone knows about it, but most
			people don't know the severity of it, or the concequenses of it.
		</p>
		<p>The message of this video is to bring attention to the mistreatment, and discrimination of homosexuals. He breaks
			it down into parts explaining what it's like to be gay in a world that hates gay people.
			The video attempts to acheive its purpose by connecting with people on an emotional level, and 
			getting people to feel what it would be like to be in such a situation. The video does well 
			in conveying its message. It can help with my paper by starting off with a story, and then delving 
			deeper into the issue, and really explaining what it is like to be in my position, and hopefully
			getting people to attach on an emotional level. Getting people on an emotional level is very difficult
			to do, but, it is the best way to get people to care about your message.

		<h1>Day 2 Blog Entry</h1>
		<p>The people targeted in this are computer gamers, people that have any experience with WoW will get a kick out
			of this. Anyone that knows anything about gaming knows about WoW, and can understand most of the refrences.
			The issues are that people will just go online to communicate with people, and not go out. This is an inherent problem
			with our generation, and is making a lot of us socially innept.
		</p>
		<p>The creators are making fun of a very large issue in society, and they aren't approaching it very seriously.
			The point of south park is to do that, so I can't really blame them. The should have taken a more mild approach,
			and talked about how this issue is widespread, and needs to be fixed.

		<h1>Day 3 Blog Entry</h1>
		<p>
			I believe that the advertisement is extremely effective in that, it captures the emotions of anyone that 
			lives in Michigan, and anyone that likes perserverance. The imagery of Detroit is some of the lower end locations,
			then it shows some of the finer sides of Detroit. Eminem is one of the big stars of Detroit, and including him into the 
			AD was an extremely good idea. Many peple like Eminem. The voiceover was very manly, and showd off the tough side of Detroit in a sense. The advertisement acheived it's purpose, which was to really make people feel for Detroit, and feel that "hell yeah" feeling."'

		<h1>Day 4 Blog Entry</h1>
		<p>
			We were introduced to the website today, as well as our first project: Lived Experiences. My overall impression of the website is that it will make the class much easier to keep track of. Getting assignments done on time should be no problem, and there will be limited confusion due to the structure of the website. The Lived Experiences sounds interesting, however, I don't know how well I will do on it, and the word requirement seems a bit difficult. Beginning Github was quite a challenge. I don’t fully understand how it works, and I’m struggling to fully grasp it. Hopefully the Code Academy goes well.
		</p>

		<h1>Day 5 Blog Entry</h1>
		<p>
		Still going on Lived Experiences. Going well so far, though I haven’t got as much done as I had wished. Pretty much got Github down, and I anticipate I will do well in this class. The peer review part was pretty much useless, no one read my draft, ha. Probably a good thing, I had wish I had got more finished with it. I did, however, get a chance to check out what everyone else was doing, as to get a fuller understanding of the requirements, and get a grasp on exactly what I needed to do. Being a coder (generally of video games), I find the HTML and CSS to be very easy, and I don’t foresee any issues in the future with building my website portfolio. I didn’t expect having to do that with this class, nonetheless, it’s not too bad overall.

		<h1>Day 6 Blog Entry</h1>
		<p>
		Lived Experiences, check, Cultural Analysis, not quite. Just got this project going, and I don’t know how well I’m going to do on it. It seems really quite hard, and the requirements are brutal. I think I’ll do fine, but, not really my cup o’ tea. I think I will be getting a 4.0 on the previous project, and I think I could nail this one when I put the work in, and there does appear to be a lot of that required to hit that 4.0. Pretty sure it should be no problem, but never know. I think I’ll do something about video games, as I am an app developer, and I know a bit about the industry. I figure that that will be the easiest for me, and will come with the least amount of pain. Code academy going well, not much to complain about, just pretty lame in my honest opinion, but you know how that goes.

		<h1>Day 7 Blog Entry</h1>
		<p>
		With cultural analysis coming to a close, I overestimated the difficulty of the project. All-in-all it went well, didn’t run into any issues along the way really. I think it furthered my writing skill, and I think I wrote a good paper. We talked about two guys in class today whose names escape me, but all I remember is that the PowerPoint was well made, but, the content was quite boring. Not really sure how you could make something about that interesting, however, I was lost/bored out of my mind within the first 30 seconds. I think my portfolio is coming along great, and I’m pretty sure that I’ll do fine in this class. Code Academy coming along slower than anticipated, getting fed up with it, probably get back at it next week, but then again probably not. Not sure if we’re supposed to be doing any assignments other than the blatantly obvious ones, but I digress, I think I’m going to excel in this course.
