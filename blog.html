	  <h1>Day 1 Blog Entry</h1>
		<p>The video was very moving. The way he depicted his life was very dark, but it was presented in such a way that it had
		a light tone. His emotion towards his uncle was very moving, I've personally never been in a situation where I lost a 
		loved one, however, I can't even begin to imagine how it would have a massive bearing on my life. Knowing that
		this man went through such a struggle, I feel very bad for him.</p>
		<p>I had no clue of the true extent that homosexuals go through, and I honestly hate the treatment that they go through.
		To think that someone would kill themselves because they felt discriminated against is extremely offputing. I am glad
		that this man made this video, and hearing his story makes me want to get involved in some way. However, I feel there
		isn't much one can do in the way of changing the general publics opinion. I do believe, however, that things are slowly 
		changing for the better, and I hope to one day see a world without such discrimination.</p>
		<p>As a straight white male, I have never been in a situation where I have been treated differently because of 
		something about me. I don't fully mean that, because I have, however, I have never been in a situation where
		I was actually hurt by something someone said about a feature of me.</p>
		<p>The world is a very cruel place, and this video has really exposed that. I for one wish it could 
			change over night, but it is much more difficult than that. Furthermore, I believe that videos
			that expose this truth really help to move along progress, and bring attention to people that really
			didn't know about the mistreatment of homosexuals. I believe that everyone knows about it, but most
			people don't know the severity of it, or the concequenses of it.
		</p>
		<p>The message of this video is to bring attention to the mistreatment, and discrimination of homosexuals. He breaks
			it down into parts explaining what it's like to be gay in a world that hates gay people.
			The video attempts to acheive its purpose by connecting with people on an emotional level, and 
			getting people to feel what it would be like to be in such a situation. The video does well 
			in conveying its message. It can help with my paper by starting off with a story, and then delving 
			deeper into the issue, and really explaining what it is like to be in my position, and hopefully
			getting people to attach on an emotional level. Getting people on an emotional level is very difficult
			to do, but, it is the best way to get people to care about your message.

		<h1>Day 2 Blog Entry</h1>
		<p>The people targeted in this are computer gamers, people that have any experience with WoW will get a kick out
			of this. Anyone that knows anything about gaming knows about WoW, and can understand most of the refrences.
			The issues are that people will just go online to communicate with people, and not go out. This is an inherent problem
			with our generation, and is making a lot of us socially innept.
		</p>
		<p>The creators are making fun of a very large issue in society, and they aren't approaching it very seriously.
			The point of south park is to do that, so I can't really blame them. The should have taken a more mild approach,
			and talked about how this issue is widespread, and needs to be fixed.

		<h1>Day 3 Blog Entry</h1>
		<p>
			I believe that the advertisement is extremely effective in that, it captures the emotions of anyone that 
			lives in Michigan, and anyone that likes perserverance. The imagery of Detroit is some of the lower end locations,
			then it shows some of the finer sides of Detroit. Eminem is one of the big stars of Detroit, and including him into the 
			AD was an extremely good idea. Many peple like Eminem. The voiceover was very manly, and showd off the tough side of Detroit in a sense. The advertisement acheived it's purpose, which was to really make people feel for Detroit, and feel that "hell yeah" feeling."'

		<h1>Day 4 Blog Entry</h1>
		<p>
			We were introduced to the website today, as well as our first project: Lived Experiences. My overall impression of the website is that it will make the class much easier to keep track of. Getting assignments done on time should be no problem, and there will be limited confusion due to the structure of the website. The Lived Experiences sounds interesting, however, I don't know how well I will do on it, and the word requirement seems a bit difficult. Beginning Github was quite a challenge. I don’t fully understand how it works, and I’m struggling to fully grasp it. Hopefully the Code Academy goes well.
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h1>Day 5 Blog Entry</h1>
		<p>
		Still going on Lived Experiences. Going well so far, though I haven’t got as much done as I had wished. Pretty much got Github down, and I anticipate I will do well in this class. The peer review part was pretty much useless, no one read my draft, ha. Probably a good thing, I had wish I had got more finished with it. I did, however, get a chance to check out what everyone else was doing, as to get a fuller understanding of the requirements, and get a grasp on exactly what I needed to do. Being a coder (generally of video games), I find the HTML and CSS to be very easy, and I don’t foresee any issues in the future with building my website portfolio. I didn’t expect having to do that with this class, nonetheless, it’s not too bad overall.
		</p>

		<h1>Day 6 Blog Entry</h1>
		<p>
		Lived Experiences, check, Cultural Analysis, not quite. Just got this project going, and I don’t know how well I’m going to do on it. It seems really quite hard, and the requirements are brutal. I think I’ll do fine, but, not really my cup o’ tea. I think I will be getting a 4.0 on the previous project, and I think I could nail this one when I put the work in, and there does appear to be a lot of that required to hit that 4.0. Pretty sure it should be no problem, but never know. I think I’ll do something about video games, as I am an app developer, and I know a bit about the industry. I figure that that will be the easiest for me, and will come with the least amount of pain. Code academy going well, not much to complain about, just pretty lame in my honest opinion, but you know how that goes.
		</p>

		<h1>Day 7 Blog Entry</h1>
		<p>
		With cultural analysis coming to a close, I overestimated the difficulty of the project. All-in-all it went well, didn’t run into any issues along the way really. I think it furthered my writing skill, and I think I wrote a good paper. We talked about two guys in class today whose names escape me, but all I remember is that the PowerPoint was well made, but, the content was quite boring. Not really sure how you could make something about that interesting, however, I was lost/bored out of my mind within the first 30 seconds. I think my portfolio is coming along great, and I’m pretty sure that I’ll do fine in this class. Code Academy coming along slower than anticipated, getting fed up with it, probably get back at it next week, but then again probably not. Not sure if we’re supposed to be doing any assignments other than the blatantly obvious ones, but I digress, I think I’m going to excel in this course.

		<h1>Day 8 Blog Entry</h1>
		<p>
		Now begins the dreaded Formal Research Project. Not a fan of doing research papers, but I do think I’ll survive. Conducting two interviews should be fine and dandy since I’m writing about business, and my dad owns a medium sized business. We also have an annotated bibliography that we had to do, hot that done quickly. Using SIRS, it is super easy to get sources. Pretty much type in what you’re looking for and BAM, right there, thousands of credible sources with tons of information that I can use. Citing is a breeze, using easybib for the uncited ones, and just ctrl+c ctrl+v for the already cited ones. What more could I ask for? Not much is the answer to that question. Scholarly article, done, trade journal, done. No problems on sources, it’s just the massive amount of content that will tear me apart. Maybe it’s just my laziness, but it is quite a rough paper.
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h1>Day 9 Blog Entry</h1>
		<p>
		Interviews, done, paper, not done. Still working on that research. Got those interviews set up and done really quickly. Basically asked my dad if I could interview him, and got that done quickly. Annotated bib all done no issues there, and Codeacademy going very well. I find Codeacademy to be interesting, yet, quite boring at the same time. I don’t know if it’s just me or if the content is just super lame. Nevertheless, I’m working through everything great. I think that getting this research project done will help me in the future even though it sucks right now. Learning how to do this kind of stuff will be extremely beneficial to me later down the road when research projects are par the course, albeit, they pretty much already are, and I should probably get used to that. All-in-all I am happy with the progress I’ve been making, and I hope the rest of the semester goes just as smoothly as the first part.

		<h1>Day 10 Blog Entry</h1>
		<p>
		Project going smoothly much to my surprise, pretty much done with it. Making this project has taught me that I shouldn’t complain before I attempt to do something, because it is generally easier than it looks on the surface, don’t read a book by its cover and all that jazz. I think the benefits of doing a project outweigh the negatives, that being said, I wish I never have to do a project like this again. It’s great and all, but the word requirement was very hard to attain, and I had to put a lot of filler where I wish I didn’t have to. Though, it could be much worse, and I probably shouldn’t complain, because really, I don’t know what the next project entails. I feel it is hard to really understand what’s going on in this class sometimes, as the instructions aren’t always clear. However, I don’t know if this is all an issue with me, or an issue with the instruction, and thus I will try to complain.

		<h1>Day 11 Blog Entry</h1>
		<p>
		Finished the paper will pretty much no problems. We were given a template for our github, and it looks nice. Glad I didn’t have to figure out how to do that solo. Over 50% on Code Academy, and I know I’ll finish on time. I still feel like I’m in the dark about everything, and I don’t know if I’m the only one feeling this way. Random things seem to be thrown at me left and right, and I don’t know what I’m supposed to do 90% of the time. Nevertheless, I am somehow doing amazing in this class, and I am not fully sure how. I am happy with this class, I just wish the instructions were clearer, and the material was talked about and explained more than it currently is. End of the day, all the projects going well, all of the work is going well, so I don’t really have any complaints worth anything. I just hope instruction the future is much clearer, as to give a better understanding of the requirements.

		<h1>Day 12 Blog Entry</h1>
		<p>
		We watched commercials in class today, kinda interesting and a switch up from the normal work on what we’re currently doing kinda class. In particular, the Eminem commercial was really good, I thought the message they were trying to convey came across well, and it gave me the feeling of pride in a weird way. I like commercials that give you that feeling, like you belong to something great. In this case, though, they’re talking about Detroit, and no matter what they say, Detroit isn’t that nice. Sure, some areas are nice, but for the most part it’s a dump. The voiceover was really good, they picked a good voice for the part, and the use of Eminem and his song was a great choice, given that he was born in Detroit. I don’t know if “Imported from Detroit” really has a positive connotation, but I like it nonetheless. I have no idea what to expect with this next project, last time I made a documentary, it was dreadful, so I hope that this one goes well.. Fingers crossed!
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h1>Day 13 Blog Entry</h1>
		<p>
		We chose poverty as our theme so to speak for our documentary. I don’t know how we’re going to pull this one off, but my group seems extremely capable, and quite nice. We got our outline done, which was quite difficult, and I’m pretty sure we were a little light on the content. However, we got out layout down, and I have high hopes for when we meet and knock this one out. I believe that we will be able to do great on it, and I expect a 3.5 or even better hopefully. Given that I have little experience in doing this, and most of my group is in the same boat, I think it will be quite hard, however, I think we will all learn a lot about film, and film design from this, and I hope that someone in my group is better at video editing than I am, because my skills are abysmal. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h1>Day 14 Blog Entry</h1>
		<p>
		We’ve got our ideas for the project down, now all we have to do is execute it. The difficult part will be finding content for it. We aren’t sure how we’re supposed to do it, so I think we plan on just getting something from other people, and citing their work. Given my lack of knowledge in this, I am going to just help find the content, and rely on one of my group members to do the video editing, given that they can’t be worse than me, I figure that’s a safe bet. I have learned that my team is for the most part also inexperienced in film creation, but given how well we work together with no arguing, I think we will be able to do great on this project, and we should have no issues in the foreseeable future. We plan to meet soon again to get everything rolling, and to start the long process of creating this project. Hope it all goes well this weekend.
		</p>

		<h1>Day 15 Blog Entry</h1>
		<p>
		We met for a second and final time last weekend, and nailed it. We got it all done, and it went smooth as butter. I hope all my group members in the future are as cool and laidback as the three I worked with on this project. The project took all in all about eight hours to complete with four people working on it. We all put almost equal work in, I believe the video editor did more than the others because his job required more, but I do believe we all did fair amounts of work. The project was not too difficult, but it did require some work. Given that none of us knew what we were doing to begin with, I’m glad that it went so well. I think that we will at least get a 3.0, which is lower that what I want, but still very good considering that we really didn’t know how to go about doing this project.
		</p>
		<h1>Day 16 Blog Entry</h1>
		<p>
			Getting everything together on the last day was a pain. So much seemed to be thrown at me in one day, I had to rush to get it all done. I totally forgot about the rough draft for the other project, so I had to get that going when I got into class which was quite stressful, and getting everything on my website didn’t go super smoothly. After everything was done, I let out a sigh in relief, but it was hectic. I am glad that everything ended so smoothly, and I think this final project will pretty much be a breeze given that it is mostly opinion and some facts about the class, and how it all went. I know that I’ll do well on this next one, and I think it is smooth sailing from here on out. I’m happy with everything this course has taught me, and the immense challenges it has thrown at my face. I hope that the semester ends well, and I can move on with the experience under my belt.
