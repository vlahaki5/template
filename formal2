			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Furthermore, John Okpara, an economist wrote about in the S.A.M. Advanced Management Journal that small businesses play key roles in a new and upcoming economy. Also, without them, no economy could start. This clearly shows that research for business is extremely important, big or small, for the development and evolution of the field as a whole. This article explores business at its roots, where it all begins. It shows how a small village can grow over time, and how it requires business to do so. It shows how business brings jobs, and a higher standard of living. It also depicts how successful businesses can make a country. John also talks about the struggles of new and upcoming businesses in a 3rd world country. As John states, “The results revealed a number of possible reasons why small businesses fail in Nigeria. Among the respondents, 386 (97%) listed lack of finance as the major reason for small business failure; this was followed by 382 (96%), who ranked lack of managerial experience as a major problem. The data revealed that 380 (96%) listed corruption and corrupt government officials as a problem for small businesses. Three hundred and seventy eight (96%) listed poor infrastructure, including poorly-maintained roads, inadequate water supply, irregular electric supply, and poor telecommunications systems, as major problems facing small businesses. Other problems mentioned were inadequate bookkeeping (373, 94%), low demand for products or services (366, 92%), lack of training (362, 91%), poor location (358, 90%), insufficient profits (349, 88%), and withdrawing too much cash for personal use (319, 81%)” (Okpara). This clearly shows that it is extremely hard for small businesses to grow in 3rd world countries, and our ability to successfully convey information about these countries makes it so the rest of the scholarly business world can understand what is going on within these countries, and people doing business know whether to invest in these countries or not. Without formal writing, businessmen and woman would not know what is going on in those countries, and without conditioning to this writing, they may not understand the message they are trying to convey.</p>
