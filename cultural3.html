			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>Video games started in the 70’s with arcades booming, and home consoles just around the corner. This is when the social problem began, home consoles. Before home consoles, people at least had to go to the arcade, however, after they could just stay home. Arcades allowed people to communicate with others about their hobby, and everyone could socially interact with each other, however, with home consoles being introduced, people just stayed home and played on their newest console. Newer and newer consoles kept getting released with increased power, and graphics. People began getting addicted at this point, people started becoming disconnected from the world, and shutting people out. As technology got better, so did the games, and the issues just grew. As mid 2000’s rolled around, people would completely disconnect. There are people that would log 100+ days in the World of Warcraft, a massively multiplayer online game by Blizzard. The addictive nature of video games led people to really take hold of them. Video games began to drag people into an endless void that hurt them in many ways that they didn’t fully understand. This was a problem for kids, primarily. Kids need to develop their social skills when they’re young, however, if they don’t get the chance to do so, they become extremely socially uncomfortable. We can see this in many kids (now young adults) of this current generation. Games like WoW led a lot of children to not fully understand social interaction, and thus they don’t know how to talk to people. Some kids even learn hostile tendencies, and think that normal social interaction involves a lot of anger.	In games such as The World of Warcraft most of the interaction is through a text box, and it is extremely easy to be hostile towards people, and thus, kids don’t understand how to truly interact with people in the real world other than the way that their used to.</p>
