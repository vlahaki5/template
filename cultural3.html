			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>When people play video games, they get immersed into a world full of exploration and fun, and they forget that there is a world around them. Games with large expansive worlds that allow exploration, and discovery are some of the biggest culprits. Being placed into a massive world with other people killing monsters, and finishing quests. Video games are an amazing experience, however, they can leads to a world of issues. These issues stem from the fact that it is very easy to get lost in this artificial world. Health aside, kids don’t fully understand the issues that they are dealing with when they pick up a controller. Games are generally looked at as hobbies, or something that one does here and there; games are hobbies for most, however, some people get extremely addicted to these artificial worlds. It is easy to say that it’s just a game, and that it will have no effect on someone beyond enjoyment, however, that is not entirely true. Video games are great however, for a teen or younger, they push them into a different understanding of the world, one where social interaction is extremely limited. Sometimes social interaction is even very hostile. This also leads to people not understanding how to truly interact, and thus they could be much more aggressive or just flat out socially awkward. Being the social creatures us humans are, we learn over time how to communicate with others, and when we limit that, we really limit our abilities. Over time, this will damage our society as a whole. If people don’t learn to be social, everyone will be effected. Due to the limited social abilities, the following generation will not be as well off as others, because we all need to know how to communicate properly for our society to function.</p>
